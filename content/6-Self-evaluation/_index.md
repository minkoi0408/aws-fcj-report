During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **08/09/2025** to **28/11/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn and practice AWS cloud services in a practical environment.

I participated in learning core AWS services and built hands-on projects, through which I improved my skills in cloud computing, infrastructure design, serverless architecture, and technical documentation.

Throughout the internship period, I maintained a consistent learning attitude, completed weekly tasks as planned, and actively explored AWS services to deepen my understanding beyond basic tutorials.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
