# Event Report “Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Track for Builders”

### Time and Theme

- **Time:** Thursday, September 18, 2025 (1:15 PM – 5:00 PM)
- **Theme:** Track B: Gen AI and Data

### Event Objectives

- Share strategies and best practices for building a unified, scalable **Data Foundation** on AWS.
- Introduce the strategic roadmap and adoption trends for **Generative AI (GenAI)** in organizations.
- Analyze the role of **AI in the Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** to improve software speed and quality.
- Guide methods and services for **securing GenAI applications** at every layer (Infrastructure, Models, Applications).

### List of Speakers

- **Jun Kai Loke** - AI/ML Specialist SA, AWS
- **Kien Nguyen** - Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Tamelly Lim** - Storage Specialist SA, AWS
- **Binh Tran** - Senior Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Taiki Dang** - Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Michael Armentano** - Principal WW GTM Specialist, AWS

### Highlights of the Content

#### 1. Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS for AI and Analytics Workloads

- **Unified Data Foundation:** Strategies for building a flexible, scalable data infrastructure to meet the demands of modern AI and Analytics applications.
- **Core Components:** Emphasis on **Data Ingestion**, **Storage**, **Processing**, and **Data Governance** aspects on AWS.

#### 2. Building the Future: Gen AI Adoption and Roadmap on AWS

- **Vision and Trends:** Sharing a comprehensive vision, key trends, and AWS's strategic roadmap for **Generative AI** adoption.
- **GenAI Services:** Introduction of AWS services and initiatives that help organizations leverage GenAI to drive innovation and efficiency.

#### 3. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Shaping the future of Software Implementation

- **Transforming SDLC:** Reshaping the software development process by embedding AI as a central collaborator throughout the entire lifecycle.
- **AI-powered Execution:** Integrating AI into the execution process with human oversight to significantly improve speed, quality, and innovation capability.

#### 4. Securing Generative AI Applications with AWS: Fundamentals and Best Practices

- **GenAI Security Challenges:** Exploring unique security risks at each layer of the GenAI stack (**Infrastructure, Models, Applications**).
- **Best Practices:** Guidance on how AWS integrates security measures like encryption, **Zero-Trust** architecture, continuous monitoring, and granular access controls to protect GenAI workloads.

#### 5. Beyond Automation: AI Agents as Your Ultimate Productivity Multipliers

- **AI Agents:** Discussion on the paradigm shift from basic automation to utilizing **AI Agents** (intelligent partners) capable of self-learning, adaptation, and autonomous execution of complex tasks.

### Key Takeaways

#### Data & AI Mindset

- **Data Foundation is Key:** All AI/Analytics efforts must start with a unified, well-governed data foundation (**Data Governance**) to ensure data quality and security.
- **GenAI is Strategy, not just a Tool:** A clear roadmap is needed to integrate GenAI into core business and operational processes.

#### Technical Architecture & Security

- **Multi-layered Security in GenAI:** Security is not limited to infrastructure; it must protect the **Model** and the **Application Flow** using measures like encryption and **Zero-Trust**.
- **AI-DLC Replaces Traditional SDLC:** Learned how to embed AI into the software development lifecycle to accelerate speed and innovation, treating AI as a collaborator.

### Application to Work

- **Strengthen Data Governance:** Apply the data governance methods learned to establish consistent data storage, processing, and security principles for future AI/ML projects.
- **Experiment with AI-DLC:** Research and pilot the integration of AI tools (like Amazon Q) into the development workflow to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Secure Design for GenAI:** When designing GenAI applications, ensure that multi-layered security principles (data encryption, access control) are applied from the start.

### Event Experience

Attending the **Track for Builders** was a highly valuable experience, marking a shift in focus from traditional infrastructure to data-driven and AI architecture.

- **Foundational and Strategic Knowledge:** I gained access not just to specific AWS services but also the overall strategy on how to build a data foundation for AI (Kien Nguyen) and the GenAI roadmap across the entire organization (Jun Kai Loke, Tamelly Lim).
- **Learning Modern Security:** Taiki Dang's presentation on GenAI security was highly useful, clarifying new vulnerabilities in the GenAI stack and how traditional security measures are extended (e.g., Zero-Trust).
- **Vision for Software Development:** Binh Tran's talk on **AI-DLC** changed my perspective on SDLC, placing AI at the center of software building.

> Overall, this event equipped me with the mindset and tools necessary to not only use GenAI but also to strategically build and secure GenAI applications safely.
