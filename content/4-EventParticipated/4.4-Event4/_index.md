# Event Report “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2: DevOps on AWS”

### Time and Theme

- **Time:** Monday, November 17, 2025 (8:30 AM – 5:00 PM)
- **Theme:** DevOps on AWS

### Event Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive understanding of the **DevOps** culture, principles, and tools on AWS.
- Guide attendees on building Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (**CI/CD**) Pipelines.
- Deep dive into **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **Containerization** on AWS.
- Introduce services and best practices for **Monitoring & Observability**.

### List of Speakers

- Detailed speaker information is not available in the original data, assumed to be AWS Vietnam Solution Architects.

### Highlights of the Content

#### 1. Morning Session: CI/CD Pipeline & IaC

- **DevOps Mindset:** Core principles and key metrics (**DORA, MTTR**).
- **AWS CI/CD Services:** **CodeCommit** (Source Control), **CodeBuild** (Build & Test), **CodeDeploy** (Deployment with Blue/Green, Canary), and **CodePipeline** (Orchestration).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Comparison and demo of **AWS CloudFormation** and **AWS CDK** (Cloud Development Kit).

#### 2. Afternoon Session: Container & Observability

- **Container Services:** Fundamentals of Docker and Microservices deployment using **Amazon ECR, ECS & EKS**.
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Using **CloudWatch** (Metrics, Logs, Alarms) and **AWS X-Ray** (Distributed tracing) to set up comprehensive system observability.
- **Best Practices:** Advanced deployment strategies (Feature flags, A/B testing) and Incident Management procedures.

### Key Takeaways

#### DevOps and System Knowledge

- **CI/CD Workflow:** Clear understanding of how to fully automate the software release process, from code commit to production deployment.
- **IaC Mindset:** Grasping the benefits and application of IaC using both CloudFormation and CDK, enabling infrastructure management as code.
- **Observability:** Understanding the difference between traditional Monitoring and modern Observability, and knowing how to use tracing to troubleshoot issues in microservices architectures.

### Application to Work
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Apply CDK to write reusable IaC templates, simplifying the deployment of test environments.
- **Pipeline Configuration:** Set up a simple CI/CD Pipeline for a personal project, using the AWS Code suite to experience different deployment strategies (Blue/Green).
- **Log/Metrics Analysis:** Utilize CloudWatch to monitor performance and create alarms for developing applications.

### Event Experience

- **Comprehensive Content:** The full-day event offered rich content, covering almost all aspects of DevOps on AWS.
- **Practical Demos:** The demos on building Pipelines and deploying with IaC visually clarified complex concepts.
- **Focus on Quality:** The emphasis on DORA metrics and Incident Management highlighted the focus on delivering business value, not just simple automation.
