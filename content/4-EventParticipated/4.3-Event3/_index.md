# Event Report “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

### Time and Theme

- **Time:** Saturday, November 15, 2025 (8:30 AM – 12:00 PM)
- **Theme:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

### Event Objectives

- Provide an overview of AWS AI/ML services.
- Detail **Amazon SageMaker** – the end-to-end ML platform.
- Deep dive into **Generative AI (GenAI)** and Foundation Models via **Amazon Bedrock**.
- Guide attendees through **Prompt Engineering** techniques and the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.

### List of Speakers

- Detailed speaker information is not available in the original data, assumed to be AWS Vietnam Solution Architects.

### Highlights of the Content

#### 1. AWS AI/ML Services Overview

- **Amazon SageMaker:** Covered the entire Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle, including data preparation, model training, tuning, deployment, and integrated MLOps.
- **Live Demo:** Hands-on demonstration with **SageMaker Studio**.

#### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

- **Foundation Models:** Comparison and guidance on choosing between models like **Claude, Llama, Titan**.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced techniques such as **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** and **Few-shot learning**.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Architecture and integration with a **Knowledge Base** to enhance accuracy and context for GenAI.
- **Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:** Building multi-step workflows and **Guardrails** (Content moderation layers) to ensure safety.

### Key Takeaways

#### GenAI and ML Skills

- **End-to-end ML Deployment:** Mastered the basic steps for building and deploying ML models on SageMaker effectively.
- **Bedrock Proficiency:** Clearly understood the components of Bedrock and the capabilities of different Foundation Models.
- **RAG Technique:** Grasping the **RAG** architecture as a critical factor for integrating GenAI into real-world enterprise applications using proprietary data.

### Application to Work
- **Building GenAI Proof-of-Concepts (PoC):** Use Amazon Bedrock to quickly prototype GenAI use cases (e.g., document summarization, internal knowledge-based chatbot) with the RAG technique.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Apply the learned Prompt Engineering techniques to improve the quality of responses from large language models.

### Event Experience

- **In-depth Practice:** The **Live Demos** on SageMaker and Bedrock were highly valuable, providing a practical view of service deployment.
- **Focus on Detail:** The event delved into technical aspects like model selection and input optimization (Prompting), giving me a more solid knowledge base compared to purely introductory events.

> This event provided a strong foundation for me to start working on Machine Learning and Generative AI projects on AWS.
